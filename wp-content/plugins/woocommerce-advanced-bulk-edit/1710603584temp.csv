We did this by using a new last the footform that gives the upper its shape. This last fits more true to size and has a slightly wider and higher toebox allowing the foot to spread out more naturally at toeoff. Also the upper of the GT-2000® 7 shoe has been enhanced with a new engineered mesh for a glove-like fit over the top of the foot. This mesh has been engineered to give more support to areas of the upper where the foot needs it and less to others for better breathability. These enhancements combine to make the GT-2000® 7 one comfortable running shoe. Make no mistake€”the GT-2000® 7 running shoe has plenty of stability designed for athletes who love to run. The added stability comes in part from the DYNAMIC DUOMAX® support system positioned under the heel and middle of the foot to guard against overpronation or the excessive inward rolling of the foot just after the foot hits the ground. FLYTEFOAM® technology is layered over the DYNAMIC DUOMAX® support system for responsive cushioning helping you run farther while supersoft SPEVAFOAM® midsole material just under the foot reduces impact to minimize the strain on your body. Reliable grip is vital for any runner and the GT-2000® 7 shoe has got that covered.
